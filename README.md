ubuntu-kernel-3.9.3
===================

Since Ubuntu made it somewhat difficult to use a custom kernel I initially thought I'd build one myself, like I frequently do with Gentoo installs I handle on a day-to-day basis. Then, I didn't, and for Ubuntus with 12.04 I stuck with kernel-ppa and version v3.11.10.x.
